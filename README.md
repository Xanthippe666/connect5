# connect5
A java-based connect-5 mini-game created for fun


All the game code is located in game.java

Uses Jframes (hoping to upgrade to Javafx, or other GUI)

Purpose is not to create a professional game, but is used for learning java purposes (Semaphores, multi-threading, abstract classes, regex
pattern matching and so forth etc.)
